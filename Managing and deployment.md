# 📦 What Are Distributions in Open Source Platforms?

In open-source platforms, a **distribution (or distro)** is a customized version of the core software that includes additional tools, configurations, and support tailored to specific needs or environments. These distros are usually built on top of an upstream open-source project.

## 🐧 Example: Linux Distributions

The **Linux kernel** is the core of the Linux operating system. Various organizations and communities build **Linux distributions** on top of this kernel by adding:

- Package managers
- Desktop environments
- Security tools
- Support and maintenance

### Common Linux Distributions:

| Distribution | Maintained By       | Use Case |
|--------------|----------------------|----------|
| **Ubuntu**   | Canonical             | User-friendly desktop, servers |
| **Red Hat**  | Red Hat Inc. (IBM)    | Enterprise-grade support |
| **Amazon Linux** | AWS               | Optimized for AWS cloud |
| **Debian**   | Debian Project        | Stable, community-driven |
| **Arch Linux** | Community           | Lightweight and customizable |

## ☸️ Example: Kubernetes Distributions

Kubernetes itself is an open-source **container orchestration platform**. Various companies and organizations provide their own **Kubernetes distributions** with:

- Pre-configured add-ons (monitoring, logging)
- Easier installation and upgrades
- Vendor support
- Cloud integrations

### Common Kubernetes Distributions:

| Distribution       | Maintained By      | Features |
|--------------------|--------------------|----------|
| **k8s (Vanilla)**  | Kubernetes Community | Pure upstream Kubernetes |
| **EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service)** | Amazon Web Services | Managed Kubernetes on AWS |
| **AKS**            | Microsoft Azure     | Managed Kubernetes on Azure |
| **GKE**            | Google Cloud        | Managed Kubernetes on GCP |
| **OpenShift**      | Red Hat             | Enterprise Kubernetes with CI/CD, security, UI |
| **Rancher**        | SUSE (formerly Rancher Labs) | Multi-cluster management |
| **k3s**            | SUSE                | Lightweight Kubernetes for edge/IoT |
| **Minikube**       | Community           | Local Kubernetes development |
